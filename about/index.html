<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="lead">
    For years, I have worked in various roles dedicated to creating art and building community one experience at a time,
    most recently as producer and director of ThirdEye Productions during my tenure as a student at New Jersey Institute
    of Technology (NJIT). In December 2019, I will be graduating from NJIT with a major in Theater Arts and Technology
    and minor in business. It is my objective to continue supporting the arts by exercising and expanding my skills in
    production.

    I have built a strong interdisciplinary skill set distinctly suited to today’s equally artistic and scientific
    marketing discipline. I understand the importance of shaping the creative process with data enabled by new
    technologies and business strategy to ensure that marketing messages fully resonate with their audience and drive
    superior business results. At the same time, as a playwright, director, and performer, I have a passion for the
    artistic aspect of marketing, understanding and empathizing with my fellow human beings on an authentic, emotional
    level as well as crafting compelling stories that engage and empower them.

<p>
    My career highlights include performing data analytics on KPMG’s internal collaboration software and presenting my
    findings to the firm’s leadership, developing innovative marketing campaigns with a reach of over 300,000, and
    managing budgets of over $400,000. Outside of work, I love watching films, reading, and spending time with my family
    and friends.
